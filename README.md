## Tech-Stack
As mentioned, this page was built in React with JSX. "Header", "Footer", and "Project" card are some of the components generated in React. Buttons in the top navigation bar use React Router to direct user to different pages.
A few Bootstrap components were used in this page in addition to regular CSS styling with mobile-first responsive design in mind.
Each project's details are passed as props from json database to the "Project" component.
